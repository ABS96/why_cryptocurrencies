I'm a software developer with a knack for falling down rabbit holes.

Many topics interest me but few manage to hold my attention for very long. Programming is one of the few that has stuck around. I have a ◊link[blog]{blog} where I write about random stuff, mostly for myself.

I am not a cryptocurrency visionary. In fact when I first heard about Bitcoin in 2010 I fired up a wallet, played around with it for a couple of minutes and then promptly forgot about it. The understanding came many years later.
