I wonder what you might think of someone who's writing a book about cryptocurrencies? Maybe you'll think of a teenage multi-millionaire or an old neckbeard raving about free software? Or perhaps an anarchist shouting "governments are evil" and "taxation is theft"?

But I am none of that. I'm just a normal person, perhaps a bit introverted but still. I only have a short beard and I pay my taxes and enjoy the benefits we get here in Sweden. Unfortunately I'm neither a teenager nor a multi-millionaire.

I first heard about bitcoin in 2010, about one year after it's creation. I installed a wallet and played around with it a little. It was just another internet thing and like many other it failed to hold my attention long enough for me to dig deeper. After about 10 or 15 minutes I removed it and promptly forgot about it (no, I've lost all keys from that time).

It wasn't until four or maybe five years later I looked at Bitcoin again. I studied computer science and we had a course in cryptography, a very fun course I might add, where we had a section about cryptocurrencies. We went through the technical details, which were part of the exam, but it made me curious about Bitcoin on a higher level. It made me read the whitepaper and I started following the development and news on social media.

I'm still at the point where I'm not actively involved in cryptocurrencies. I hang out on reddit and follow the development and I own a little but I'm not writing code or working for a project. While I am a software developer I don't have a cryptocurrency project I burn for enough to work on it on my free time. Ever since I started programming fulltime I just don't have energy for it like I had during my University years.

Instead my time has been taken up by my 1.5 year old kid, my girlfriend and other hobbies. After my parental leave we decided that I should work part time to avoid long days at pre-school.

Working less has also opened up time and energy for me to work on a side project. Writing a book has been on my bucket-list so why not do it now? Interest in cryptocurrencies is at very high levels and even my dad asked me about it. It feels like there's a need for information I might be able to fill.

I have a ◊link[blog]{blog} where I write about random stuff, mostly for myself.
