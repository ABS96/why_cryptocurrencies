I wonder what you might think of someone who's writing a book about cryptocurrencies? Maybe you'll think of a teenage multi-millionaire or an old neckbeard who thinks all software must be free? Or perhaps an anarchist shouting "governments are evil" and "taxation is theft"?

But I am none of that. I'm just a normal person, perhaps a bit introverted but still. I only have a short beard and I pay my taxes and enjoy the benefits we get here in Sweden. Unfortunately I'm neither a teenager nor a multi-millionaire.

I first heard about bitcoin in 2010, about one year after it's creation, and I installed a wallet and played around a little. It was just another internet thing that failed to hold my attention long enough for me to dig deeper. After about 10 or 15 minutes I promptly forgot about it.

It took many years until I looked at Bitcoin again.

I'm a software developer with a knack for falling down rabbit holes.

Many topics interest me but few manage to hold my attention for very long. Programming is one of the few that has stuck around. I have a ◊link[blog]{blog} where I write about random stuff, mostly for myself.

I am not a cryptocurrency visionary. In fact when I first heard about Bitcoin in 2010 I fired up a wallet, played around with it for a couple of minutes and then promptly forgot about it. The understanding came many years later.
