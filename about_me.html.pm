I wonder what you might think of someone who's writing a book about cryptocurrencies? Maybe you'll think of a teenage multi-millionaire or an old neckbeard raving about free software? Or perhaps an anarchist using slogans like "governments are evil" and "taxation is theft"?

But I am none of that. I'm just a normal person, perhaps a bit introverted but still. I only have a short beard and I pay my taxes and enjoy the benefits we get here in Sweden. Unfortunately I'm neither a teenager nor a multi-millionaire.

I first heard about bitcoin in 2010, about one year after it's creation. I installed a wallet and played around with it a little. It was just another internet thing for me and like many other it failed to hold my attention. After about 10 or 15 minutes I removed it and promptly forgot about it (no, I've lost all keys from that time).

It wasn't until four or maybe five years later I looked at Bitcoin again. I studied computer science and we had a course in cryptography, a very fun course I might add, where we had a section about cryptocurrencies. We went through the technical details and it made me curious about Bitcoin on a higher level. I read the white paper and began follow the news and development in the space.

I'm still at the point where I'm not actively involved in cryptocurrencies. I hang out on Reddit, follow the development and I own a little but I'm not writing code or working for a project. While I am a software developer I don't have a cryptocurrency project I burn for enough to work on it on my free time. Unfortunately ever since I started programming full-time I just don't have energy for it, like I had during my University years.

The free time I do have has been taken up by my 1.5 year old boy, my girlfriend and other hobbies. Saying no to something is saying yes to something else.

After my parental leave we decided that I should work part time to avoid long days at pre-school.  Working less has also opened up time and energy for me to work on a side project. Writing a book has been on my bucket-list so why not do it now? My girlfriend has always been super supportive of my silly ideas.

I have a ◊link[blog]{blog} where I write about random stuff, mostly for myself.
