I wonder what you might think of someone who's writing a book about cryptocurrencies? Maybe you'll think of a teenage multi-millionaire or an old neckbeard raving about free software? Or perhaps an anarchist who's trying to convince you that "governments are evil" and that "taxation is theft"?◊mn{there-are}

◊ndef["there-are"]{
    It's easy to see why cryptocurrencies might attract people like this. Cryptocurrencies are all about freedom, and the free software movement (saying that ◊strong{all} software should be free) and anarchism seek freedom to the extreme.
}

But I am none of that. I'm just a normal person, perhaps a bit introverted but still. I only have a short beard and I pay my taxes and enjoy the benefits we get here in Sweden. Unfortunately I'm neither a teenager nor a multi-millionaire.

I first heard about Bitcoin in 2010, about one year after it's creation. I installed a Bitcoin wallet and played around with it a little. It was just another internet thing for me and like many others it failed to hold my attention. After about 10 or 15 minutes I removed it and promptly forgot about it.◊mn{had-some}

◊ndef["had-some"]{
    I did have a couple of Bitcoins at that time. It hurts to admit this as today a single Bitcoin is worth around $9,000, but sadly I've lost them. After all, back then they weren't worth anything.
}

It wasn't until four or maybe five years later I looked at Bitcoin again. I studied computer science and we had a course in cryptography---a very fun course I might add---with a section about cryptocurrencies. We went through the technical details and it made me curious about Bitcoin on a higher level. I read the white paper and began following the news and development in the space.

I'm still at the point where I'm not actively involved in cryptocurrencies. I hang out on Reddit, follow the development and I own a little but I'm not writing code or working on a project. While I work as a software developer I don't have a cryptocurrency project I burn for enough to work on it on my free time. Unfortunately ever since I started programming full-time it's been difficult to find energy for side-projects, like I had during my University years.

The free time I do have has been taken up by my two boys, my girlfriend and other hobbies. Saying no to something is saying yes to something else.◊mn{hobbies}

◊ndef["hobbies"]{
    My current hobbies include ◊link[bjj]{Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu}, boardgames and standard low-effort ones such as reading books or watching videos.

    I have a very on-and-off relationship with my hobbies, which I pick up and do intensely for a short period of time. For instance I've been into ◊link[lockpicking]{lockpicking}, ◊link[go]{Go} and learning Korean, which I would like to start again some day.

    I have a ◊link[blog]{blog} where I write about random stuff, mostly for myself. It's also, as you might imagine, not updated regularly.
}

After my parental leave we decided that I should work part time to avoid long days at pre-school.  Working less has also opened up time and energy for me to work on a side project, and writing a book has been on my bucket-list so I thought "why not do it now"? My girlfriend, wonderful as she is, has always been super supportive of my silly ideas.

Am I qualified to write about cryptocurrencies? Am I a cryptocurrency expert? I don't know. I just see myself as an enthusiast who's trying to write down and share my thoughts. Please keep that in mind when you consider any claims I make---I may very well miss something important.
