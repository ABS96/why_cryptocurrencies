This book is completely free for you to read online and will be so forever. There will be no ads, no tracking and no crypto mining in the browser.◊sn{browser-mining} There won't even be any javascript on the site.

If I some day finish the book and decide to release it in other formats I may charge for them, but the web version will always be free.

◊subhead{Then why donate?}

Because without revenue the book dies.

If you think the book was worth your time please consider donating. I'm relying on your generosity to fund writing it. And if you don't think the book was worth your time, sorry for wasting it.

◊subhead{Donations is a perfect use for cryptocurrencies}

◊ndef["browser-mining"]{
    Some sites have replaced ads on their sites and instead use visitors' computers to mine for them. A novel way to use cryptocurrencies but with questionable efficiency.
