If we're going to talk about cryptocurrencies and whether they're useful or not we need to know what they are. If we don't know what they do and what properties they have how can we tell what value---if any--- they have?

Technical understanding of how they work is beneficial but not required to discuss their usefulness. It's enough to know what they do differently compared to alternatives and what properties they have. If you find it too hard to accept they can live up to their claims I encourage you to do further research.
