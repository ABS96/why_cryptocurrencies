"Bitcoin is an extremely important innovation, but not in the way most people think. Bitcoin's real innovation is a globally verifiable proof publishing at a certain time. The whole system is built on that concept and many other systems can also be built on it. The blockchain nails down history, breaking Orwell's dictum of "He who controls the present controls the past and he who controls the past controls the future."
- Julian Assange

“All the perplexities, confusion and distress in America arise, not from defects in their Constitution or Confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.” — John Adams

"It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning." — Henry Ford

"Let me issue and control a nation's money and I care not who writes the laws." — Mayer Amschel Rothschild

"I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. Already they have raised up a monied aristocracy that has set the government at defiance. The issuing power (of money) should be taken away from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs.” — Thomas Jefferson

## Black markets

There's a concept one should have in mind when talking about black markets:

> Legality doesn't imply morality

For example slavery used to be legal but most would agree it's immoral. Conversely a homeless boy stealing food to prevent his little sister from starving may be illegal but also moral.

Therefore black market usage isn't easily dismissed with "it's illegal" and we should look a little closer at some examples.

But first what is a black market? In short it's a term for a market where transactions are illegal in some way. Obviously buying illegal things or services but it also includes tax violations and transactions outside government control.

This includes paying a craftsman off the books, something that doesn't bother a lot of people.  Or if you've accidentally made any mistakes with taxes on a transaction (happens quite often although without repercussions). 

Also in countries with a lot of corruption or dysfunctional governments black markets are huge. For example in the Soviet Union many people relied on black markets to get their food supply when the market economy failed them. Or in Greece during their economic breakdown where the black market was [estimated at 20 to 25 percent of the GDP](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/world/europe/greece-bailout-black-market.html):

> The heart of the matter for an ever-rising number of citizens and businesses is that they simply do not have the financial resources anymore to meet their rising tax obligations

Black markets have typically preferred physical cash because it's permissionless nature. With cryptocurrencies there's now a digital equivalent.  An additional to a digital variant is it's easier to store and move especially in larger amounts.

In particular cryptocurrencies enable dark net markets where you can buy and sell stuff online. Contrary to popular belief these too operate with their own morality where they're mostly about subsets of drugs and medicine.

To see the positive side of dark net markets consider this example and try to see yourself in it:

> Your wife got diagnosed with cancer. Despite having insurance it only covers a part of the extremely high medical costs in the US and you're looking at a yearly expense of $20,000 just for the medicine she needs. This is just too much for you to afford but she needs the medicine otherwise she'll die.

What if I told you the same medicine could be bought in India for a fraction of the cost? What if there was a way to easily order it online? Even if it was illegal would you do it? What if the risk of getting caught was very small? There are variations of the same story, [here's one with a bit more detail](https://darkwebnews.com/news/high-costs-force-patients-to-dark-net-in-search-of-needed-medicine/).

This is exactly what cryptocurrencies and dark net markets gives you.

##  New asset class

<https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/02/bitcoin-correlation-assets-diversify/>


<https://midlifecroesus.com/2018/01/bitcoin-non-correlated-asset/>

Bitcoin is not strongly affected by normal macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates, taxes, economic or trade policy. As such, it is possible that the correlation value of Bitcoin to equities is closer to 0 than -100.

Indeed, this is the opinion of the founders of Ark Invest. Their whitepaper “Bitcoin: Ringing the Bell for a New Asset Class” describes the nuances of different asset classes, such as stocks, gold, real estate, commodities against the performance of Bitcoin.

If so, the lack of correlation could make an investment in Bitcoin, and possibly other cryptocurrencies,  an attractive alternative asset class to consider in a diversified portfolio that could weather a storm and experience growth, long term.

<https://research.ark-invest.com/hubfs/1_Download_Files_ARK-Invest/White_Papers/Bitcoin-Ringing-The-Bell-For-A-New-Asset-Class.pdf>


Cryptocurrencies have weak relationships with established asset classes, which can be good or bad depending on what role you want them to play in your portfolio. This could change if more institutional investors such as banks and hedge funds start buying digital tokens, but for now cryptocurrencies mostly just move in line with each other.
