 “If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—for ever.”
― George Orwell, 1984 

“He who controls the spice controls the universe.”
― Frank Herbert, Dune 

 “War is peace.
Freedom is slavery.
Ignorance is strength.”
― George Orwell, 1984 

“All the perplexities, confusion and distress in America arise, not from defects in their Constitution or Confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.” — John Adams

"I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. Already they have raised up a monied aristocracy that has set the government at defiance. The issuing power (of money) should be taken away from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs.” — Thomas Jefferson

##  New asset class

<https://www.valuewalk.com/2018/02/bitcoin-correlation-assets-diversify/>


<https://midlifecroesus.com/2018/01/bitcoin-non-correlated-asset/>

Bitcoin is not strongly affected by normal macroeconomic factors, such as interest rates, taxes, economic or trade policy. As such, it is possible that the correlation value of Bitcoin to equities is closer to 0 than -100.

Indeed, this is the opinion of the founders of Ark Invest. Their whitepaper “Bitcoin: Ringing the Bell for a New Asset Class” describes the nuances of different asset classes, such as stocks, gold, real estate, commodities against the performance of Bitcoin.

If so, the lack of correlation could make an investment in Bitcoin, and possibly other cryptocurrencies,  an attractive alternative asset class to consider in a diversified portfolio that could weather a storm and experience growth, long term.

Cryptocurrencies have weak relationships with established asset classes, which can be good or bad depending on what role you want them to play in your portfolio. This could change if more institutional investors such as banks and hedge funds start buying digital tokens, but for now cryptocurrencies mostly just move in line with each other.

    "The magic money machine" - money isn't created, it just magically appears in the bank's balance
    The FED is not a government agency. It's a private entity and its shareholders are banks which earn a dividend. As much as 80 billion dollars per year, total.

    The FED is practicing planning economy. It is bound to make mistakes even with the best of intentions.

    Our financial crisis had everything to do with virtual dollars. Too many people with very little income borrowed a lot of money they could never repay.
    But the banks didn't care. They didn't have to. They quickly made and sold shaky loans to someone else, for a profit.
    Selling bad loans was a good business, until the whole thing blew up in a global financial crisis.

    The magic money machine destroyed 30 million real jobs.
    Ex-barclays bankers charged with Libor rigging (CNN Money)

## The Big Short

    It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble.
    It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.
            Mark Twain


https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anSPG0TPf84
Margot Robbie: [In a bubble bath with a glass of champagne] Basically, Lewis Ranieri's mortgage bonds were amazingly profitable for the big banks. They made billions and billions on their 2% fee they got for selling each of these bonds. But then, they started running out of mortgages to put in them. After all, there are only so many homes and so many people with good enough jobs to buy them, right? So, the banks started filling these bonds with riskier and riskier mortgages. [Butler pours more champagne into her glass] (Thank you, Benjamin) That way, they can keep that profit machine churning, alright? By the way, these risky mortgages are called "subprime." So, whenever you hear the word "subprime," think "shit." Our friend, Michael Burry, found out that these mortgage bonds that were supposedly 65% AAA, were actually just, mostly, full of shit, so now, he's going to "short" the bonds, which means "to bet against." Got it? Good...[Takes a sip of champagne] Now, fuck off.


Mortgage backed securities (mortgage bonds)
But ran out of mortgages. The banks started filling these bonds with riskier and riskier mortgages (subprime).
Supposeduly safe securities are mostly shit.

    bad loans, it's a time bomb

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vrv9odqUvlw
OK, I'm a chef on a Sunday afternoon, setting the menu at a big restaurant. I ordered my fish on Friday, which is the mortgage bond that Michael Burry shorted. But some of the fresh fish doesn't sell. I don't know why. Maybe it just came out halibut has the intelligence of a dolphin. So, what am I going to do? Throw all this unsold fish, which is the BBB level of the bond, in the garbage, and take the loss? No way. Being the crafty and morally onerous chef that I am, whatever crappy levels of the bond I don't sell, I throw into a seafood stew. See, it's not old fish. It's a whole new thing! And the best part is, they're eating 3-day-old halibut. *That* is a CDO. 


But at least we're going to see some of them go to jail.
Except they took the money the American people gave them and gave themselves huge bonuses.

A single banker went to jail.

In 2015, several banks began selling billions in something called a "bespoke tranche opportunity."
Which, according to Bloomberg News, is just another name for a CDO.

## The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine, Michael Lewis

 “What are the odds that people will make smart decisions about money if they don’t need to make smart decisions—if they can get rich making dumb decisions?”
― Michael Lewis, The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine
