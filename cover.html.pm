I'm looking for a cover page for my book. There is an online version that's free for all to read, but I want to convert it to a physical book and an eBook (PDF and epub) and I'd like to commission a cover page for it.

◊subhead{What I'm looking for}

I'm looking for an original illustration, with a sort-of a cartoony feel that complements my own images inside the book (see below for examples).

These pictures capture some of the feel I'm going for:

◊figure[#:class "flex-33"]{
    ◊raw-img[#:src "https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nostarch.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimagecache%2Fproduct_full%2Flyah.png&f=1&nofb=1" #:alt ""]{}
    ◊raw-img[#:src "https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fnostarch.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fimagecache%2Fproduct_full%2Flisp.png&f=1&nofb=1" #:alt ""]{}
    ◊raw-img[#:src "https://i.pinimg.com/236x/41/3c/12/413c1240c1d1ea431ee13982645157ab--art-store-art-pages.jpg" #:alt ""]{}
}

◊todo{List some covers with the feel I'm going for}

I envision a cover you can look at and identify some of the topics I bring up in the book. Maybe a city or a small town where you can see these things:

◊ul{
    ◊li{Icons/symbols of cryptocurrencies.

        Ones I've mentioned in the book are Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Monero, Ethereum and Dogecoin:

        ◊figure[#:class "flex-20"]{
            ◊raw-img[#:src "/images/cover-help/btc.png" #:alt "Bitcoin"]{}
            ◊raw-img[#:src "/images/cover-help/bch.png" #:alt "Bitcoin Cash"]{}
            ◊raw-img[#:src "/images/cover-help/monero.png" #:alt "Monero"]{}
            ◊raw-img[#:src "/images/cover-help/ethereum.png" #:alt "Ethereum"]{}
            ◊raw-img[#:src "/images/cover-help/doge.png" #:alt "Dogecoin"]{}
        }

        Maybe hidden away as graffiti, or as a small sign hidden in a store window. The Bitcoin symbol should be easily identified somewhere on the cover, and preferably Monero as well.

        They don't necessarily have to keep their colors, as long as they're identifiable. The Bitcoin unicode symbol "₿" could for example be used.
    }
    ◊li{A person with a ◊link[fawkes]{guy fawkes mask} (privacy)}
    ◊li{Someone building a pyramid of bills (inflation)

        ◊img[#:src "/images/german_notes.png" #:alt "bills"]{
            An image I've used in the book. ◊link[stacks]{Inspired by this picture}.
        }
    }
    ◊li{A banker running a printing press, spraying bills everywhere (financial crisis)}
    ◊li{An S&M pair exiting a sex-toy shop (privacy)}
    ◊li{Gambling, poker chips or blackjack? (provably fair gambling)}
    ◊li{An homeless person holding a sign with a QR code (cashless dystopia)}
    ◊li{A toilet door with a lock you have to use a credit card for, possibly next to the homeless person (cashless dystopia)}
    ◊li{A police officer threatening someone to give them their stuff (protection against government confiscation)

        ◊img[#:src "/images/gangster_cop.png" #:alt "Cop"]{
            An image I've used for this scenario.
        }
    }
    ◊li{People buying medicine in an alley (darknet markets)}
    ◊li{A kid holding a bowl of soup (global currency)}
    ◊li{Schrödinger's cat, with a marijuana symbol, stuck in a box (undesirable businesses)

        The cat in the box is simultaneously dead and alive, you don't know until you open it.
    }
    ◊li{A blind man leading a pack of other blind people to their doom (blind leading the blind)}
    ◊li{A rich pig (◊link[animal-farm]{like in Animal Farm})}
    ◊li{◊link[delorean]{A DeLorean} (time machine in Back to The Future) (timestamping service)}
    ◊li{A military helicopter firing at people (uncensorable donations, collateral murder)}
    ◊li{Assange is stuck in the Ecuadorean embassy, with angry US officials outside. Maybe Trump, Obama and Bush? (uncensorable donations)}
    ◊li{A farmer trading a pig for a chair (what is money?)

        ◊img[#:src "/images/pig_chair_exchange.png" #:alt "Barter"]{
            An image I've used in the book.
        }
    }
    ◊li{Someone walking around with a bag of gold, or a gold bar (what is money?)}
    ◊li{A snake oil salesman trying to sell poison (an skull on the bottle or something?) (look out for snake oil)}
    ◊li{A lamborghini (common reference in the cryptocurrency sphere)}
    ◊li{Other historical examples of money I've used, see ◊link[historical-examples-of-money]{this list of historical examples of money}.

        For instance:

        ◊ol{
            ◊li{Slave trade using sea shells}
            ◊li{A 3 meter big stone coin}
            ◊li{A huge coin transported in a wheelbarrow}
        }
    }
}

The center of the cover could be a person who's lost, with a map in hand or question marks above the head, to signify that the book is about to explain these things.

Clutter might become a problem here, so it's not necessary to include ◊em{all} these things.


◊subhead{Images in the book}

There are a few images in the book, and it would be awesome if the cover could match the cartoony style of them, but obviously massively improved.

Here's a bunch of them:

◊figure[#:class "flex-50"]{
    ◊raw-img[#:src "/images/send_crypto.png" #:alt ""]{}
    ◊raw-img[#:src "/images/sending_network.png" #:alt ""]{}
}

◊figure[#:class "flex-50"]{
    ◊raw-img[#:src "/images/generals_decisions.png" #:alt ""]{}
    ◊raw-img[#:src "/images/global.png" #:alt ""]{}
}

◊figure[#:class "flex-25"]{
    ◊raw-img[#:src "/images/20kg_copper.png" #:alt ""]{}
    ◊raw-img[#:src "/images/doge.png" #:alt ""]{}
    ◊raw-img[#:src "/images/dancing.png" #:alt ""]{}
    ◊raw-img[#:src "/images/bitcoin-priest.png" #:alt ""]{}
}

◊figure[#:class "flex-50"]{
    ◊raw-img[#:src "/images/income-inequality-world.svg" #:alt ""]{}
    ◊raw-img[#:src "/images/encrypted_mailbox.png" #:alt ""]{}
}

◊figure[#:class "flex-50"]{
}

◊figure[#:class "flex-50"]{
    ◊raw-img[#:src "/images/coinjoin.png" #:alt ""]{}
    ◊raw-img[#:src "/images/monero-transactions2.png" #:alt ""]{}
}



◊subhead{What I don't want}

◊ul{
    ◊li{Focus on a single cryptocurrency.

        A big Bitcoin symbol as the cover, which is common for books on this topic, is for example off the table.
    }
}


◊subhead{Other details}

◊ol{
    ◊li{I'm looking for someone experienced, to help me avoid common pitfalls.}
    ◊li{I'll self-publish using ingram spark.}
    ◊li{I'd like the raw image files.}
    ◊li{The physical book should have a complete cover, for the front, back and side.}
    ◊li{The cover should work for PDF and epub/mobi as well.}
    ◊li{If you'd like I can pay you with a cryptocurrency of your choice.}
