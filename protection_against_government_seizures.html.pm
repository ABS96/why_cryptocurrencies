◊subhead{Inflation}

There is another way governments can take money from you: by inflating the money supply and using the excess money for themselves. It's a more indirect---and perhaps sinister---way to take money from you as you probably won't notice it. After all they aren't taking something physically from you, you still have your cash in your mattress and numbers in your bank account are unchanged, but they now buy you less stuff.

◊todo{Inflation chart}

Have you asked your grandmother or your great-grandmother what they used to buy when they were little?

◊todo{Some cute image here}

We'll go into the more extreme version of inflation, which can destabilize the whole country, in a ◊link[hyperinflation-rel]{later chapter}.

◊subhead{What cryptocurrencies does}

To summarize what cryptocurrencies can do for us if we want to protect ourselves against the different kinds of government seizures:

◊ol{
    ◊li{It allows you to hold any amount of money}
    ◊li{If you use strong encryption, nobody can confiscate it (unless they use force on you)}
    ◊li{You can bring your money everywhere}
    ◊li{The government cannot invalidate your money}
    ◊li{There is nobody who can inflate the money supply}
}
