To be able to talk about cryptocurrencies and what value they might bring we need to at least understand what they do differently.

In short: **Permissionless and trustless digital transfers**.

There are many projects who call themselves cryptocurrencies while not fulfilling the criteria. For example I don't consider these real cryptocurrencies:

* Onecoin
* Bitconnect
* Stablecoins like [Tether][] or JP Morgan's [JPM coin][].
