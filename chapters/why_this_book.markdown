# Why this book


Whenever the topic of cryptocurrencies&mdash;where Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most known&mdash;come up in conversations they're almost always not understood or dismissed.

Arguments mostly come in one of these forms:

* It's just a scam
* It's just a speculative bubble like Beanie Babies[^beanies] or the Tulip mania[^tulips]
* It's an environmental disaster
* They don't do anything better than other payment systems like PayPal or VISA
* There's no legal use case

It's almost a universal phenomena. I've heard these arguments from students, co-workers, friends, family and highly technical online communities. It seems everyone has an opinion but few seem capable of explaining what it is or what it does differently.

Of course most aren't dismissive but simply don't understand what it's all about. Many are curious and want to learn more.

As a cryptocurrency fan I'm often in the position to defend it and try to bring up how it can be useful, what use cases exist and even how it can help society. I've tried to answer these questions several times but it gets old fast.

This is why I've decided to collect my thoughts of why cryptocurrencies exist, what they can do and what value they bring. Hopefully I can answer the question: "Why cryptocurrencies?".

I will not go into technical detail and stick to high level concepts, although I might make a note or two where applicable. Neither will I focus on the implementations that exist today and what challenges they face (like scaling, micro-payments, privacy and environmental impact). Rather I will try to show what value cryptocurrencies bring both today and what they might in the future.

Finally it's not about any specific implementation. Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency but there are hundreds more[^cryptos]. This is about the properties of a cryptocurrency which can be provided in several different ways.

And of course none of this is investment advice.


[^beanies]: How does it relate to cryptos?

    At it's height people would sell&mdash;and buy&mdash;these toys at 10x their original price and was responsible for 10% of eBay's sales. The creator was at one point one of the richest men in the world.

[^tulips]: Describe tulip fever and how it relates to cryptocurrencies.

    Although commonly refered to it wasn't as bad as it's often portrayed as. But it was still quite bad.

[^cryptos]: Although there are hundreds and perhaps thousands most are just copies or outright scams. Be safe out there.
