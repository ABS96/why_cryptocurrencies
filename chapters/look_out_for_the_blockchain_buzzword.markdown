There are many projects who call themselves cryptocurrencies while not fulfilling the criteria. For example I don't consider these real cryptocurrencies:

* Onecoin
* Bitconnect
* Ripple
* Stablecoins like [Tether][] or JP Morgan's [JPM coin][].

[Tether]: https://tether.to/
[JPM coin]: https://decryptmedia.com/5173/jp-morgan-coin-cryptocurrency

After the invention of proof-of-work there have been attempts to solve the Byzantine generals problem in other ways. For example instead of miners who expend energy proof-of-stake works by allowing users with coins vote. There are different security trade-offs and the jury is still out if they really solve the problem sufficiently.

Then there's the phenomena where a technology gets hyped up and businesses all over rush to adopt it in any way they can. That is instead of searching for a solution for a problem they have they take a solution and search for a problem they can fit it to. Much like using a hammer to paint walls in a house.

That's been true of "big data", "neural networks" and now "blockchain".

Instead of using cryptocurrencies, where anyone can join in and vote, they want to remove the consensus mechanism and use a private blockchain. But doing that removes all advantages and benefits.




The main problem for businesses with cryptocurrencies is they're open for anyone to join in and vote. So they want to make a private blockchain 


Here are some legit cryptocurrencies, but there are others:

* Bitcoin (BTC)
* Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
* Ethereum (ETH)
* Monero (XMR)
* Litecoin (LTC)
* Dogecoin (DGC)
