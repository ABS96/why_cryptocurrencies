title: What is money?

**Legar tender**

There aren't any hard rules for what money is. This is perhaps surprising but if we look at what has been used as money historically we see things like:

* Sea shells

* (1000 - 1400) Rai stones: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stones>
* \(1644) A 20kg copper coin: <https://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/about-the-riksbank/history/1600-1699/the-worlds-largest-coin/>
* \(19th century) Gold
* \(1923) Hyperinflation germany

What is money changes depending on both time and place.

Money is actually a social construct. (expand on this...)

Therefore it's more illuminating to look at how money is used. Many economists and experts agree that money is a:

* Medium of exchange
* Unit of account
* Store of value
(images of the above with examples)


This raises some interesting questions:

* Can anything be used as money?
* Are there "good" and "bad" forms of money?
FIXME refer back to "good" and "bad"?

To fulfil the above functions money should therefore be:

1. **Divisible**: Can be divided into smaller units of value.
1. **Fungible**: One unit is viewed as interchangeable with another.
1. **Portable**: Individuals can carry money with them and transfer it to others.
1. **Durable**: An item must be able to withstand being used repeatedly.
1. **Acceptable**: Everyone must be able to use the money for transactions.
1. **Uniform**: All versions of the same denomination must have the same purchasing power.
1. **Limited in Supply**: The supply of money in circulation ensures values remain relatively constant.

(Go through the above money examples and see how they hold up)

## Divisible

+ Cigarettes can be divided into packs and individual cigarettes.

= Gold bars can be split into smaller bars or coins. Coins usually come in different denominations. Although you run into trouble if you don't have the correct denominations, you can't split a gold bar into coins on the street for example.

- This is a problem with "barter economy". How do you pay for a single piece of bread if you can only pay with cows?

## Fungible

+ Fiat is fungible by law.
- Beaver pelts aren't very fungible. Some are of higher quality and others are of lower.

## Portable

- Take the 20kg copper coin as a ridiculous example.
= Gold and paper money also isn't super portable. They're heavy and require a lot of space.
+ Digital money is portable. Money in your mobile phone is excellent.

## Durable

- Sea shells break down quickly after use.
= Fiat coins and bills are much better but they too fade and gets ripped and needs to be replaced.
+ Gold is practically indestructible.

## Acceptable

+ Fiat is near universal. Although movements towards a "cash free society" has deminished the usefuleness of cash in some places.
= Gold can be seen as an international money, but you cannot use pure gold coins to buy stuff in stores.
- School yard rubber bands only work within a small subset of students

## Uniform

+ Fiat coins and bills. Gold in specific quantities.

## Limited in supply

+ Gold
= Fiat
- Sea shells

Anything that fulfills these properties can be considered as money[^wikipedia]

# Functions

## Medium of Exchange

* **Definition**: Can be used to intermediate the exchange of goods and services.
* **Use**: A common ground for determining value.
* **Example**: A community uses beaver pelts as a medium to trade for other goods.

## Unit of Account

* **Definition**: A standard numerical unit of measurement of market value for goods, services, and other transactions.
* **Use**: Can be used to compare goods using a common system.
* **Example**: Housing prices in Japan can be compared using the yen as a unit of account.

## Store of Value

* **Definition**: Maintains its value over time.
* **Use**: Can be spent or exchanged at a later date without penalty.
* **Example**: An ounce of gold could buy a toga in Roman times, yet it can still buy a nice suit today.

# Properties

In other words:

1. **Divisible**: Can be divided into smaller units of value.
1. **Fungible**: One unit is viewed as interchangeable with another.
1. **Portable**: Individuals can carry money with them and transfer it to others.
1. **Durable**: An item must be able to withstand being used repeatedly.
1. **Acceptable**: Everyone must be able to use the money for transactions.
1. **Uniform**: All versions of the same denomination must have the same purchasing power.
1. **Limited in Supply**: The supply of money in circulation ensures values remain relatively constant.


Fiat money doesn't derive it's value from use as a physical commodity but from being declared by a government to be legal tender. That is it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country for all debts, public and private.


# Is cryptocurrencies money?

Some countries&emdash;[like Sweden][skatt-bitcoin]&emdash;have ruled that Bitcoin isn't a currency because there is no responsible issuer and not a legal tender in any country.

Others have ruled in favor of Bitcoin as a currency. For example [EU ruled][] that cryptocurrency exchanges doesn't require VAT and are tax free.

Let's look at the different properties of money instead:

## Divisible

Cryptocurrencies is much more divisible than the alternatives. One Bitcoin can for example be split into 100 000 000 satoshis. The cryptocurrency protocol can be made to support smaller denominations as well.

You can send any kind of value directly from your wallet. There's no need to mix and match coins of different denominations to find the correct amount.

## Fungible

One coin is like any other. Caveat: the coin history can be traced in Bitcoin which can compromise fungibility. See Monero as an example of a fungible cryptocurrency.

## Portable

You can carry any amount you want in your wallet. One billion worth of cryptocurrency is as easy to carry as one cent. There's no difference in transacting large amounts or small amounts.

## Durable

Coins do not deteriorate.

## Acceptable

Anyone can accept cryptocurrencies as long as they have access to a smart phone or a computer and internet.

But just because everyone can accept it doesn't mean they are. Adoption wise cryptocurrencies still have a long way to go.

## Uniform

Again, one coin is like any other. It doesn't matter if the coin is new or old.

## Limited in supply

A cryptocurrency follows a set issuance schedule. For example Bitcoin is deflationary as every 4th year the amount of bitcoins created each year is halved until the max limit of 21 million coins is reached. After that no more bitcoins will be created.

![replace with own plot?](https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/upload/en/images/7/70/How_many_bitcoins_are_in_circulation_.jpg)

Comparison of Monero and Bitcoin: <https://imgur.com/a/De0G2>

But it doesn't have to be deflationary. You can for example create a cryptocurrency with a fixed 2% inflation every year, or 10% or 0%. There's no technical limitation here, the supply can be as limited as you want.


As we can see cryptocurrencies stand up very well compared to the other forms of money.

For instance cryptos are more divisible, portable, durable and has a tighter controlled supply than fiat currencies.

What cryptos lack is mainly adoption. Not enough people are using it. In modern times gold has this problem as well, I doubt you'll find regular merchants who accept gold as payment anymore. In fact it's more likely that you'll find merchants who accept cryptocurrencies than gold.


## Medium of exchange

It can be used. Most aren't.

## Unit of account

It can be used. Most aren't.

## Store of value

This doesn't hold, at all.

While cryptocurrencies have nice properties it's primarily a speculation vehicle and it's been notoriously


# So, is cryptocurrencies money?

It has the properties for being a very good type of money. Maybe even a better money than any alternative so far.

But it doesn't fulfil all the criteria:

* It's too volatile
* It's not accepted enough
* It's not commonly used to price goods and services

Which can be summarized as "the adoption isn't there yet". Perhaps it will get there some day, perhaps not.

Keep in mind that the other forms of money aren't perfect either:

* Gold isn't accepted as payment either
* Fiat isn't a very good store of value either.
    It's a predictable one when inflation is stable but that eats away value very quickly.
* Paper bills can get ripped and destroyed
* In a "cash less society" people without banks cannot accept or pay using fiat.
    This erodes the acceptable property of fiat
* Cash isn't very portable in large quantities
* Banks violate the limited supply principle with excessive fractional banking and bad loans
    More that later

In the end it's up to you if you think cryptocurrencies is money or not. But it doesn't really matter if it fits into the traditional definition of money. What matters is what cryptocurrencies is useful for.
