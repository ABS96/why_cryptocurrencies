# Properties of money (or, what is money?)

There aren't any hard rules for what money is. This is perhaps surprising but if we look at what has been used as money historically we see things like:

* Many different kinds of coins
* A 20kg copper coin: <https://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/about-the-riksbank/history/1600-1699/the-worlds-largest-coin/>
* Rai stones: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rai_stones>
* Beaver pelts
* Cigarettes in prison
* Rubber bands on the school yard
* Dollar notes
* Gold bars
* Sea shells

What is money changes depending on both time and place.

Money is actually a social construct. (expand on this...)

This raises some interesting questions:

* Can anything be used as money?
* Are there "good" and "bad" forms of money?

Fiat money doesn't derive it's value from use as a physical commodity but from being declared by a government to be legal tender. That is it must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country for all debts, public and private.


# Is cryptocurrencies money?

Some countries&emdash;[like Sweden][skatt-bitcoin]&emdash;have ruled that Bitcoin isn't a currency because there is no responsible issuer and not a legal tender in any country.

Others have ruled in favor of Bitcoin as a currency. For example [EU ruled][] that cryptocurrency exchanges doesn't require VAT and are tax free.
