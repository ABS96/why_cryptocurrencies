    We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, "Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."

In previous sections we've looked at how cryptocurrencies provide ◊link[digital-payments]{better digital payments} and why they might be ◊link[currency]{better currencies}. This section focuses on some ways the world is changing, and what part cryptocurrencies play.

Even if we'd collectively agree that the world would be better off without cryptocurrencies, we cannot make them disappear. We cannot "uninvent" them and they're extremely difficult to shut down.

    There's an excellent ◊link[hh-destroyer]{Hardcore History episode} on the topic of nuclear weapons and how humanity has been balancing on the edge of destruction ever since their invention.

The Pandora's Box has been opened, and for better or worse, the world will change.
