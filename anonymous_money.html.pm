    Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.

◊subhead{You do have something to hide}

Often when people argue about the importance of privacy we can summarize the discussion like this:

◊ul[#:class "talking"]{
  ◊li{Why do I need privacy? I have nothing to hide.}
  ◊li{Then pull your pants down, give me a dick pick, your email password and your credit card numbers.}
}

While crude it cuts right to the chase: you do in fact have things which are best to hide. Your passwords and credit card numbers◊sn{cc-numbers} is a good example: you should hide them because of security reasons.

◊ndef["cc-numbers"]{

}

After all we don't have curtains or blinders on our windows because we do something illegal, it's because we like 

◊ol{
  ◊li{You do in fact have something to hide.}
  ◊li{Security and privacy are related.}
  ◊li{The right to privacy means you have a ◊em{choice}.}
}


◊subhead{Others have very important things to hide}

Now even if you still don't think you have anything to hide, remember that others do. If we give up our right to privacy then everyone have to give up theirs as well.

Here are some examples where a lack of economic privacy is directly harmful for certain individuals:

◊ol{
  ◊li{Unwanted pregnancies.

      There was a story that went viral years ago on how Target ◊link[teenage-pregnancy]{predicted a teenage pregnancy and exposed it to her father}. In a normal western household it might not be that big of a deal, but remember that ◊link[murder-family-honor]{thousands of women are killed each year} for family "honor". Often for much less than a teenage pregnancy, such as ◊link[dowry-murder]{not getting paid enough for marrying the bride}.
  }
  ◊li{Sexual preferences.

    While homosexuality is becoming more accepted it's still ◊link[gay-illegal]{illegal in some countries} where you might face execution. Similar to the story of the girl's pregnancy above, having a history of your purchases might expose you.

    There is also nothing wrong with having a fetish and engaging in strange sexual fantasies in your own home, but maybe you don't want your neighbourhood to know you bought a vibrating horse dildo.◊sn{porn-story}

    ◊ndef["porn-story"]{
        I read a story long ago, but I can't remember if it was real or made up.

        It was about a couple and their son who liked to play with their neighbours. They were happy to let him, the neighbours were really friendly, and they liked to spend time with them too. But one day they found an amateur porn DVD---the neighbours apparently liked to create homemade porn.

        The DVD never harmed them, and their son didn't know about it, but they never allowed their son to visit the neighbours anymore and the couple stopped spending time with them because it "felt weird".

        I guess the point of the story is some things are best left unknown.
    }
  }
  ◊li{A cause for oppression.

    In China if you're end up on the ◊link[china-social-credit]{wrong side of their social credit system}, you're banned from spending on "luxuries". If prospective business partners or customers discovers your status as a "deadbeat" you might get shunned and your hope of climbing out of your situation disappear. Keeping your economy private to outsiders would be a great help.

As Snowden's quote in the beginning of the chapter says: just because you choose not to exercise your right, why should that mean we remove the right for others?
