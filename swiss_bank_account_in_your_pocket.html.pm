◊subhead{The Panama Papers}

Maybe you'll say this is extremely unwanted as it would enable tax-fraud on a global scale. And you'd have a point, there's just one issue: it's already possible.

◊subhead{Inequality}

Let's see what the president of the United States has to say about tax evasion:

◊qt[#:url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBZR1-onmAo"
    #:src "Trump debates with Clinton"]{
    Clinton: He didn't pay any federal income tax.
    Trump: That makes me smart.
}

No Mr. President, that makes you rich. You see, this kind of tax evasion is only available for the very rich. And it's not the 1%, more like the 1% of the 1%. We're talking about people with private chefs and who travels the world in private jets and yachts. This is why you don't see the names of normal people in the Panama Papers, but instead we'll find names like Lionel Messi, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.◊sn{names}

◊ndef["names"]{
    It's funny because you can find Trump's name in the Panama Papers 3,450 times, while ◊link[putin-proxies]{Putin uses proxies} to try and hide his involvement. Does that make Putin smarter than Trump?
}
