Each chapter is supposed to be standalone so you can jump around and read it however you want. The only prerequisite is to have a basic understanding of what a cryptocurrency does which I describe in ◊link[the-first-chapter]{the first chapter}.

If you want to receive an email when I post a new chapter please ◊link[subscribe]{subscribe here}. I will only use it to email you about this book and you can unsubscribe at any time.

There is also an ◊link[rss]{RSS feed} if you prefer that.

Should describe navigation and styling?

No javascript.
