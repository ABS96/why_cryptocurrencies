Each chapter is supposed to be standalone so you can jump around and read it however you want. The only prerequisite is to have a basic understanding of what a cryptocurrency does which I describe in ◊link[the-first-chapter]{the first chapter}.

This book is a work in progress and if you want to keep up to date you have three options:

◊ul{
  ◊li{Subscribe to the ◊link[rss-feed]{RSS feed}}
  ◊li{Follow the changes on ◊link[source-code]{Github}}
  ◊li{Join the email list

      ◊|subscription-form|}
}

Links to outside are colored heavy orange and internal links are of a brighter orange. For example compare the link to ◊link[source-code]{Github} and to the ◊link["/"]{home page}. There is no tracking on this site but there may very well be on external sites, this serves as a small signifier if you care about that.

Links to previous and next chapter can be found at the bottom as well as at the edge of the screen.

While I do my very best apart from close friends I don't use an editor so there may be errors in the book. Therefore I would be most grateful for any feedback, ideas or error corrections you the reader may find. You can ◊link[mailto]{email me} or create a pull request or an issue ◊link[source-code]{on Github}.
