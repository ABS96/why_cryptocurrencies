# What do law makers say?

Several countries&mdash;[like Sweden][skatt-bitcoin]&mdash;have ruled that Bitcoin isn't a currency because there is no responsible issuer and not a legal tender in any country.

Cryptocurrencies just doesn't fit into the existing rules to be classified as a fiat currency. One of the defining rules of fiat is to have a responsible issuer&mdash;something Bitcoin was created to remove.

There are others who've ruled in favor of Bitcoin as a currency. For example [EU ruled][] that VAT is not applicable to the conversion between fiat currency and Bitcoin, however VAT still applies when used for goods and services.

Regardless if Bitcoin is classified as a traditional currency it can still be and function as money. After all many historical examples of money can't be called fiat currency either.

# Properties of money

Let's look at the different properties of money instead:


Divisible

:    Cryptocurrencies is much more divisible than the alternatives. One Bitcoin can for example be split into 100 000 000 satoshis. The cryptocurrency protocol can be made to support smaller denominations as well.

    You can send any kind of value directly from your wallet. There's no need to mix and match coins of different denominations to find the correct amount.


Fungible

:   One coin is like any other. Caveat: the coin history can be traced in Bitcoin which can compromise fungibility. See Monero as an example of a fungible cryptocurrency.


Portable

:   You can carry any amount you want in your wallet. One billion worth of cryptocurrency is as easy to carry as one cent. There's no difference in transacting large amounts or small amounts.


Durable

:   Coins do not deteriorate.


Acceptable

:   Anyone can accept cryptocurrencies as long as they have access to a smart phone or a computer and internet.

    But just because everyone can accept it doesn't mean they are. Adoption wise cryptocurrencies still have a long way to go.


Uniform

:   Again, one coin is like any other. It doesn't matter if the coin is new or old.


Limited in supply

:   A cryptocurrency follows a set issuance schedule. For example Bitcoin is deflationary as every 4th year the amount of bitcoins created each year is halved until the max limit of 21 million coins is reached. After that no more bitcoins will be created.

But it doesn't have to be deflationary. You can for example create a cryptocurrency with a fixed 2% inflation every year, or 10% or 0%. There's no technical limitation here, the supply can be as limited as you want.


As we can see cryptocurrencies stand up very well compared to the other forms of money.

For instance cryptos are more divisible, portable, durable and has a tighter controlled supply than fiat currencies.

What cryptos lack is mainly adoption. Not enough people are using it. In modern times gold has this problem as well, I doubt you'll find regular merchants who accept gold as payment anymore. In fact it's more likely that you'll find merchants who accept cryptocurrencies than gold.


# Functions of money

## Medium of exchange

It can be used. Most aren't.

## Unit of account

It can be used. Most aren't.

## Store of value

This doesn't hold, at all.

While cryptocurrencies have nice properties it's primarily a speculation vehicle and it's been notoriously


# So, are cryptocurrencies money?

It has the properties for being a very good type of money. Maybe even a better money than any alternative so far.

But it doesn't fulfil all the criteria:

* It's too volatile
* It's not accepted enough
* It's not commonly used to price goods and services

Which can be summarized as "the adoption isn't there yet". Perhaps it will get there some day, perhaps not.

Keep in mind that the other forms of money aren't perfect either:

* Gold isn't accepted as payment either
* Fiat isn't a very good store of value either.

    It's a predictable one when inflation is stable but that eats away value very quickly.

* Paper bills can get ripped and destroyed
* In a "cash less society" people without banks cannot accept or pay using fiat.

    This erodes the acceptable property of fiat

* Cash isn't very portable in large quantities
* Banks violate the limited supply principle with excessive fractional banking and bad loans

    More that later

In the end it's up to you if you think cryptocurrencies are money or not.

But does it really matter if cryptocurrencies fits into the traditional definition of money? Instead their properties and usefulness should be the important bits.
