When I first started thinking about cryptocurrencies I thought it was just useful for some people who couldn't use regular transactions, like buying weed or things on a darknet market. Or that it was a better payment system as there was no middleman to skim of large fees from all transactions. That's useful, but it didn't strike me as revolutionary.◊sn{fees}

◊ndef["fees"]{
    I do think ◊link[cheaper-faster]{avoiding 1--3%} fees on practically all digital payments is an under-appreciated benefit of cryptocurrencies. It might be overshadowed by the volatility, but the potential benefit to the economy is absolutely huge.
}

But the idea of separating money from state made me go "Wow, that could actually be huge." Here we have money with excellent monetary properties that's not controlled by any state, and if adopted on a large scale it would change the global economy forever.

This isn't groundbreaking in itself, as ...

I know it might be difficult to entertain the notion that a country shouldn't control their own money, and that the mere suggestion is outrageous. Here I find the parallel to the relationship between religion and state relevant.

For many centuries, millennia even, religion and the state were inseparable. I'm not even sure it was a conscious decision, rather the mere idea that it could be any other way was simply unthinkable. For many that's just how it was, like how the sun rose every morning or that you got hungry without food.

Countless rulers have based their legitimacy on religious grounds, that they should rule because God says so. This is useful, since you have to question God to question them, and who are you to question God? For example both the Roman emperors and the Japanese emperors used this to legitimise themselves. Even today it's very common that the church should be the one to crown the kings and queens, as if to say "we give you the right to rule".◊sn{carolus-rex}

◊ndef["carolus-rex"]{
    Charles XII of Sweden, also called "Carolus Rex", acknowledged the power of God but rejected the church when he placed the crown upon his own head instead of letting someone from the church do it.
}

This is why it was a big deal when the Swedish king ◊link[gustav-vasa]{Gustav Vasa} took steps towards the ◊link[reformation]{Protestant Reformation}. It wasn't motivated by religious reasons---he simply wanted control over the church's property. In a sense the Diet at Västerås in 1527 was the first step in separating the church from the Swedish state, a process that was ◊link[separation]{completed in 2000} when they were formally separated.

Separating church from the state was once unthinkable, yet it's now a given that the church shouldn't dictate what the state should do. In a similar way the notion that money could be separated from the state is today largely considered unthinkable, but that doesn't mean it'll be that way forever.

◊subhead{Not that unusual}

In practice some countries have already separated money from their state, as they use money someone else control. For example the ◊link[euro]{Euro} is managed by the ◊link[ecb]{European Central Bank (ECB)}, and the countries that use the Euro have very little influence in the ECB's decision-making (well, most of them anyway). There are also countries that ◊link[countries-use-us]{use the U.S. dollar as their official currency}, while having no say in what the U.S. does with it.

Gold might also be an example of money outside of state control---there's nobody with exclusive access to gold after all. But in practice someone has to convert the gold to coins for it to be usable as money, and that includes a "government approved" stamp on them, which gives some sort of control over the money. After all, it's difficult to determine what a coin is made of so we just trust the stamp on it.

Maybe a better example is shell money, or other money found in nature, where you just pick up them up and start using them. Although they're lacking compared to coins or modern money, there's no one in charge of minting or stamping shells.

So the idea that a state doesn't require control over their own money isn't really that strange, as there are many examples of the contrary.


◊subhead{The difference with cryptocurrencies}

With the various historical examples we might wonder what cryptocurrencies bring to the table. Why would they be different?

For starters all modern examples where a state doesn't control their own money simply mean they'll use someone else's money. There's always a state in control of the money, it's just some other state. With cryptocurrencies there's no single entity in control, meaning it's money separate from any state.◊sn{indirect-control}

◊ndef["indirect-control"]{
    States can apply indirect control. For example if the U.S. passes anti-cryptocurrency laws, it would have a negative effect on the usefulness of cryptocurrencies. Similarly if they would pass beneficial laws, cryptocurrencies would become more useful, simply because the U.S. have such a large influence throughout the world.
}

Cryptocurrencies are also different from the "natural" forms of money, such as shells or stones, because they have better monetary properties. For instance the supply in a cryptocurrency is provably limited, while you always run the risk of someone discovering a mountain of shells on some remote island somewhere. Cryptocurrencies being digital means they're easier to transport and to send over larger distances, making global interaction much easier.

(They're simply better money, that comes from the people and that's global...)

◊;There's one question I leave unanswered, and that's if completely separating money from state is altogether useful. I leave it up to you, the reader, to decide.


◊subhead{What will the future hold?}

It's impossible to predict the future. For example the iPhone was released in 2007 and today almost everyone carry a smartphone in their pocket. This is particularly crazy because they're ◊link[apollo-smartphone]{millions of times more powerful} than all of the combined computing power of NASA that put man on the moon 50 years ago.

Nobody could've predicted this explosive technological development, so how can we predict where cryptocurrencies will take us? We can't, but the mere possibility that it could lead to the separation of money and state is interesting to think about.

For instance what if countries abandoned fiat and started using cryptocurrencies instead? And I don't mean fake cryptocurrencies like ◊link[e-krona]{E-krona} where the Swedish central bank would retain control, but money completely without a central authority. How would the world change?

In the section ◊link[better-currency]{a better currency} I argued that several problems with the modern economy could be mitigated by such a move. That it would fix the moral hazard established after the ◊link[financial-crisis]{financial crisis in 2008}, which means that banks are incentivized to push the global economy to it's limits, disastrous consequences be damned. It would also reign in ◊link[defective-system]{the unchecked spending}, as governments lose their money printing "get out of jail free card", and would have to be more responsible in their decision-making.

But it could also mean that countries have ...

Whether that would be a good or bad thing, I leave up to you, the reader, to decide.
