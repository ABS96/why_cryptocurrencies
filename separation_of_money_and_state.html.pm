When I first started thinking about cryptocurrencies I thought it was just useful for some people who couldn't use regular transactions, like buying weed or things on a darknet market. Or that it was a better payment system as there was no middleman to skim of large fees from all transactions. That's useful, but it didn't strike me as revolutionary.◊sn{fees}

◊ndef["fees"]{
    I do think ◊link[cheaper-faster]{avoiding 1--3%} fees on practically all digital payments is an under-appreciated benefit of cryptocurrencies. It might be overshadowed by the volatility, but the potential benefit to the economy is absolutely huge.
}

But one idea made me go "Wow, that could be massive!" And that's how cryptocurrencies for the first time in modern history make it possible for money to be completely separated from the state and other institutions.

  No allegiance, I will swear no oath
  Crowned by God not by the church as my power is divine
}

I know it might be difficult to entertain the notion that a country shouldn't control their own money, and that the mere suggestion is outrageous. Here I find the parallel to the relationship between religion and state relevant.

For many centuries, millennia even, religion and the state were inseparable. I'm not even sure it was a conscious decision, rather the mere idea that it could be any other way was simply unthinkable. For many that's just how it was, like how the sun rose every morning or that you got hungry without food.

Countless rulers have based their legitimacy on religious grounds, that they should rule because God says so. This is useful, since you have to question God to question them, and who are you to question God? For example both the Roman emperors and the Japanese emperors used this to legitimise themselves. Even today it's very common that the church should be the one to crown the kings and queens, as if to say "we give you the right to rule".◊sn{carolus-rex}

◊ndef["carolus-rex"]{
    Charles XII of Sweden, also called "Carolus Rex", acknowledged the power of God but rejected the church when he placed the crown upon his own head instead of letting someone from the church do it. It's what Sabaton meant with "crowned by God not by the church".
}

This is why it was a big deal when the Swedish king ◊link[gustav-vasa]{Gustav Vasa} took steps towards the ◊link[reformation]{Protestant Reformation}, which weakened the political power of the church.

◊subhead{Not even that unusual}

In practice some countries already have separated money from their state, as they use money someone else control. For example the ◊link[euro]{Euro} is managed by the ◊link[ecb]{European Central Bank (ECB)}, and the countries that use the Euro have very little influence in the ECB's decision-making (well, most of them anyway). There are also countries that ◊link[countries-use-us]{use the U.S. dollar as their official currency}, while having no say in what the U.S. does with it.

Gold might also be an example of money outside of state control---there's nobody with exclusive access to gold after all. But in practice someone has to convert the gold to coins for it to be usable as money, and that includes a "government approved" stamp on them, which gives some sort of control over the money. After all, it's difficult to determine what a coin is made of so we just trust the stamp on it.

Maybe a better example is shell money, or other money found in nature, where you just pick up them up and start using them.

So the idea that a state doesn't have to have control over their own money isn't really that strange, as there are many examples of the contrary.
