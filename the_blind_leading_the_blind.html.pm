One of the most common arguments against sound money---like cryptocurrencies or money backed by gold---is that you lose the ability to react to the market. For example during a depression you could try to stimulate the economy to avoid the bad effects. This lies at the heart of Keynesian economic theory where you're supposed to push on the gas pedal during harsh economic times and pull on the breaks during good times. ◊sn{elaciticity}

◊ndef["elaciticity"]{
    ◊em{Elaciticity} is a nice word fractional banking proponents have used to describe this ability. In plain English it means the ability to inflate and deflate the money supply freely.
}

But there is a fatal flaw with this argument: it relies on being able to predict the market and to know what actions to take to move it in the direction you want. I'll argue that these assumptions don't hold up well.


◊subhead{How to become an expert}

To become an expert in a field of course you need a lot of dedication, effort and maybe a bit of talent.◊sn{10000h} But as Daniel Kahneman points out in his book "Thinking, Fast and Slow" you also need the right environment to develop expertise:

◊ndef["10000h"]{
    There's a misunderstood myth that you only need 10,000 hours, or that you need at least 10,000 hours before you become an expert. But that's not the truth, with the right environment and ◊em{dedicated practice} you can become an expert much faster and if you use your time inefficiently you may never become one.

    Think for example of the teenage golf prodigies who eclipse the middle-aged men---who've spent their entire lives playing golf---in no time at all.

For example picking stock is notoriously difficult, so difficult that in general you'll be better off investing in a passive index fund than picking stock yourself. This may not be surprising but it also applies to professional investors, most of whom under-perform against the index! This is because the stock market isn't regular enough to be predictable.◊sn{wicked-env}

◊ndef["wicked-env"]{
    There's also a "wicked" environment where you're likely to learn the wrong lesson from your experience. The example given is of a physician who tried to tried to confirm his a hypothesis for who might develop typhoid. Unfortunately he tested his hunch by palpating the patient's tongue, without washing his hands, making him draw the wrong conclusion.
}

In contrast learning how to drive a car provides an ideal learning environment. You'll get instant feedback whenever you break or use the gas pedal, when you turn the steering-wheel the car turns and you'll quickly find out if you changed gears correctly. While similar learning how to maneuver a large ship is more difficult because of the delayed feedback.

◊subhead{Our leaders are blind}

Because the economy on a global scale is so incredibly complex it's extremely hard, some would say impossible, to accurately predict how it'll behave. Just look at the ◊link[financial-crisis]{financial crisis in 2008} which in hindsight should've been obvious, but it took almost everyone by surprise.◊sn{black-swan}

◊ndef["black-swan"]{
    The 2008 crisis is an example of a ◊em{black swan} event. Impossible to predict before it happens but obvious in hindsight. Coincidentally the meteoric rise of Bitcoin can also be considered a black swan.

Here are some quotes from some of the leading experts of the world, merely months before the financial meltdown:

◊qt[#:author "The Federal Reserve"
    #:date "August, 2007"
    #:url "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-rates-idUSN0722343620070808"]{
  Financial markets have been volatile in recent weeks, credit conditions have become tighter for some households and businesses, and the housing correction is ongoing.

  Nevertheless, the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.

  When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated. But as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.
}

The Federal Reserve fanned the flames of the housing bubble by focusing on inflation and keeping the rent low, all the way up to the crash. During the crisis the FED bailed-out Bear Stearns but let Lehman Brothers fail, which has been widely criticized afterwards.◊sn{music-stops}

◊subhead{We are blind}

◊qt[#:author "Henry Ford"]{
    It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.
}

One might argue that we're blind because we don't understand how the banking system work, what consequences printing money out of thin air have and how we're ignorant of how the modern monetary system work.

Do the people really know that the least accountable operation in the U.S. government isn't the FBI, CIA or the NSA---which are all accountable to congressional supervision---but it's the FED? The Federal Reserve System, the U.S. central bank, is not accountable to anyone, has no budget and nobody has insight into it's operations.

◊qt[#:author "Frank Herbert"

      He who controls the spice controls the universe.
}

It's worse than us not understanding how the system works because the FED, the "controller of the universe", makes us all blind. We can't even tell how many dollar bills really exist.
