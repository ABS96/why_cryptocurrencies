Markup
+ Published and modified dates should be visible in chapters

+ Use <cite> when refering to books, or things with titles
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite
  See the financial crisis, where we refer to things inside text.
+ Use <time> in quotes (and other? but it's probably overkill to even bother.)
+ Use <caption> for <table>? Instead of placing it in a figure with caption?
