Completeness:
+ Rewrite link handling (automatically format books and signal missing alt-text)
  Book handling
  Def handling (see em(link(charge-back-fraud)) in eli5)
+ Alt-text for all links

Further:
+ Examine how to generate epub
+ Start creating a pdf
+ Self-publish a book

Additional image ideas:
+ Monster bankster
+ Gift cards trading?
+ An image of me in front of the computer (cartoon stick dude style) (about me)
+ Schrödinger's marijuana (undesirable businesses)
+ A blind man leading a flock of blind men (blind leading the blind)
+ An unstable system (a defective system)
  Dude sitting on a stick, and other dudes trying to keep him from falling
+ Anonymous mask smoking a joint (darknet markets)
+ A medicine bottle (darknet markets)
+ Rich pigs (swiss bank account)
+ A DeLorean (timestamping service)
+ Graph of transaction fees, for visual comparison (cheaper faster)
+ Killing someone in the background, an official saying "nothing to see here"
+ EatBCH picture? But need to get in contact with someone first

+ An image for each section? To make it easier to remember?
  Maybe have it to the right of epigraphs?
    For mobile phones have it directly below?

  About the book:
  What is a cryptocurrency?: A gold coin
  Better digital payments:
  Brave new world: A nuke or pandora's box
  Extensions:

Code:
- Better link handling

Style:
- Better way to refer to book sources for paragraphs
- Use ◊def{} for all definitions and style them similarly

Markup
+ Use <cite> when refering to books, or things with titles
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite
  See the financial crisis, where we refer to things inside text.
+ Use <time> in quotes (and other? but it's probably overkill to even bother.)
+ Use <caption> for <table>? Instead of placing it in a figure with caption?

Sanity:
+ Alt-text for all links
+ Setup cross chapter links after all chapters are written
