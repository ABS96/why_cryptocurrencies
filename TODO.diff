Summarize better:
+ What is a cryptocurrency?
+ How do cryptocurrencies work?
  Move summary to the beginning instead of at the end
+ What is money?
+ Are cryptocurrencies money?

+ Better digital payments
+ Cheaper & faster
  Move conclusion to the beginning? Or just expand beginning?

+ Undesirable businesses
+ Freezing of merchant accounts
+ Uncensorable donations
+ For the unbanked
  These chapters all don't mention cryptos in the beginning, but maybe we should?

+ A better currency
+ A global currency
  Place a small summary before "Remittance"

Rewrite:
+ Read through earlier chapters for more polish
- Rewrite cryptos in 5 minutes

Write:
+ Separation of money and state
+ Tokens
+ Verifiable voting
+ Fill up crypto challenges
+ Introduction to cryptography
+ (Further research)

Additional image ideas:
+ Gangster cop
+ Monster bankster

+ An image of me in front of the computer (cartoon stick dude style) (about me)
+ Schr√∂dinger's marijuana (undesirable businesses)
+ A blind man leading a flock of blind men (blind leading the blind)
+ An unstable system (a defective system)
  Dude sitting on a stick, and other dudes trying to keep him from falling
+ Anonymous mask smoking a joint (darknet markets)
+ A medicine bottle (darknet markets)
+ Rich pigs (swiss bank account)
+ A DeLorean (timestamping service)
+ Graph of transaction fees, for visual comparison (cheaper faster)
+ Killing someone in the background, an official saying "nothing to see here"
+ EatBCH picture? But need to get in contact with someone first

+ An image for each section? To make it easier to remember?
  Maybe have it to the right of epigraphs?
    For mobile phones have it directly below?
