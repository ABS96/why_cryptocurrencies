    Underlined links are ugly, especially inside quotes
    Need to remake some images to be transparent
    Other images needs to have a background to be legible
        Dashed/dotted underlined links are ugly as well...
    No breaking things inside tables and other stuff?
    Tables look fine otherwise!
    Sneaky Steve first image looks borked, in reversing transactions
        Figcaption for tables/images in particular a global currency
        Remove left hand bar from quotes
    Provably fair gambling code is fucked up
    Prevent headers from going to the next page?
+ Look at game programming patterns to see if there's a tag or something we should use
+ What epub: tags should we use?

+ Rewrite about section

- Ensure font size is correct for all elements (sidenotes, lists, quotes...)
- Style images
- Style tables



Test with:
+ okular
+ calibra


Completeness:
+ Book citations should include a page number

Further:
+ Examine how to generate epub
+ Start creating a pdf
+ Self-publish a book

Additional image ideas:
+ Monster bankster
+ Gift cards trading?
+ An image of me in front of the computer (cartoon stick dude style) (about me)
+ Schrödinger's marijuana (undesirable businesses)
+ A blind man leading a flock of blind men (blind leading the blind)
+ An unstable system (a defective system)
  Dude sitting on a stick, and other dudes trying to keep him from falling
+ Anonymous mask smoking a joint (darknet markets)
+ A medicine bottle (darknet markets)
+ Rich pigs (swiss bank account)
+ A DeLorean (timestamping service)
+ Graph of transaction fees, for visual comparison (cheaper faster)
+ Killing someone in the background, an official saying "nothing to see here"
+ EatBCH picture? But need to get in contact with someone first

+ An image for each section? To make it easier to remember?
  Maybe have it to the right of epigraphs?
    For mobile phones have it directly below?

  About the book:
  What is a cryptocurrency?: A gold coin
  Better digital payments:
  Brave new world: A nuke or pandora's box
  Extensions:

Style:
- Use ◊def{} for all definitions and style them similarly

Markup
+ Published and modified dates should be visible in chapters

+ Use <cite> when refering to books, or things with titles
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/cite
  See the financial crisis, where we refer to things inside text.
+ Use <time> in quotes (and other? but it's probably overkill to even bother.)
+ Use <caption> for <table>? Instead of placing it in a figure with caption?
